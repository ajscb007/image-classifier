# Image-Classifier using a CNN
Image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network.

### INSTRUCTIONS:
Install virtualenv if you dont have one already. Then install the dependencies. Here's how:

Installing Virtualenv:
```sh
$ pip install virtualenv
```
Creating a Virtual Environment:
```sh
$ virtualenv myprojectenv
```
Activating the Virtual Environment:
```sh
$ source myprojectenv/bin/activate
```
Navigate to the image-classifier folder and run:
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once the dependencies are installed, run the Jupyter notebook:
```sh
$ jupyter notebook Image_Classifier.ipynb
```

And of course, before you run the Jupyter notebook kernel, download the dataset from this [link](http://google.com) and paste it inside the directory in your project folder.
